The goal of this proposed [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) project is to write a [Mailman 3](http://wiki.list.org/Mailman3) plugin that enables
the listserver to send and receive PGP-signed and -encrypted mail.

There will be more content here if my proposal gets accepted.
